class McSlidePlayer(McConfigPlayer):
    """Base class for the Slide Player that runs on the mpf-mc side of things.
    It receives all of its instructions via BCP from a MpfSlidePlayer instance
    running as part of MPF.

    The slide_player: section of a config file (either the machine-wide or
    a mode-specific config) looks like this:

    slide_player:
        <event_name>:
            <slide_name>:
                <slide_settings>: ...

    The express config just puts a slide_name next to an event. (In this case
    it assumes the slide has already been defined in yours slides: section)

    slide_player:
        some_event: slide_name_to_show

    If you want to control other settings (such as a display target, priority,
    transition, etc.), enter the slide name on the next line and the settings
    indented under it, like this:

    slide_player:
        some_event:
            slide_name_to_show:
                target: dmd
                transition: fade

    Alternately you can pass a full configuration. You can also pass a widget
    or list of widgets to create the slide if based on the settings in the
    slide_player. Here are several various examples:

    slide_player:
        some_event:
            slide1:
                transition: move_in

        some_event2:
            slide2:

                    type: move_in
                    direction: right
