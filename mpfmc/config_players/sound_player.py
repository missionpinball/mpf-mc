    """Base class for the Sound Player that runs on the mpf-mc side of things.
    It receives all of its instructions via BCP from a MpfSoundPlayer instance
    running as part of MPF.

    The sound_player: section of a config file (either the machine-wide or
    a mode-specific config) looks like this:

    sound_player:
        <event_name>:
            <sound_name>:
                <sound_settings>: ...

    The express config just puts a sound_name next to an event.

    sound_player:
        some_event: sound_name_to_play

    If you want to control other settings (such as track, priority, volume,
    loops, etc.), enter the sound name on the next line and the settings
    indented under it, like this:

    sound_player:
        some_event:
            sound_name_to_play:
                volume: 0.35
                max_queue_time: 1 sec

Here are several various examples:

    sound_player:
        some_event:
            sound1:
                volume: 0.65

        some_event2:
            sound2:
                volume: -4.5 db
                priority: 100
                max_queue_time: 500 ms
